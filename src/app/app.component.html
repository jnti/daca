      <p class="lead">
        On June 15, 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced that certain people who came to the United States
        as
        children and meet several guidelines may request consideration of
        deferred action for a period of 2 years, subject to renewal. They are also eligible to request work
        authorization.
        Deferred action is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion to defer
        removal action against an individual for a certain period of time. Deferred action does not provide lawful
        status.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        On Aug. 30, 2022, DHS published the DACA Final Rule, with the intent to preserve and fortify the DACA policy.
        This rule, which puts into effect regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25, rescinds and replaces the DACA guidance
        set forth in the 2012 Memorandum issued by Secretary Napolitano.
